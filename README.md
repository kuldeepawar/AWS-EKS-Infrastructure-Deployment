## AWS-EKS-Infrastructure-Deployment

## Problem Statement: AWS EKS Infrastructure Deployment

### Background:  
The provided architecture diagram illustrates a highly available AWS infrastructure setup across two availability zones (us-east-1a and us-east-1b). It consists of public and private subnets, security groups, and networking components like route tables and NAT gateways. The infrastructure is designed for hosting a scalable and secure application, potentially on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

### Challenges to Address:
1.Automated Deployment with Terraform:  
   - Implement infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform to provision the AWS networking components, including VPC, subnets, route tables, and security groups.
   
2.High Availability and Redundancy:
   - Ensure that the application can handle failovers by deploying across multiple availability zones.

3. Networking and Security Configuration:
   - Properly configure private and public subnets for workload isolation.
   - Implement security group rules to allow controlled access between application components.
   - Set up a NAT gateway to enable private subnets to access the internet securely.

4.Scalability and Load Balancing:  
   - Integrate an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic across multiple instances or EKS worker nodes.
   - Ensure private subnets are used for backend services and databases.

5. Logging and Monitoring:
   - Implement logging and monitoring solutions (such as CloudWatch, Prometheus, and Grafana) to track system health.

6. CI/CD Integration:
   - Automate deployments using a CI/CD pipeline with Terraform, Kubernetes, and Helm.

Expected Outcome:
A fully automated, scalable, and secure AWS infrastructure that supports an EKS-based application deployment, ensuring high availability, proper network segmentation, and security best practices.
